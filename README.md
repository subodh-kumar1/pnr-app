TS Config Details
- lib: The standard typing to be included in the type checking process. In our case, we have chosen to use the types for the browserâ€™s DOM and the latest version of ECMAScript.
- allowJs: Whether to allow JavaScript files to be compiled.
- allowSyntheticDefaultImports: This allows default imports from modules with no default export in the type checking process.
- skipLibCheck: Whether to skip type checking of all the type declaration files (*.d.ts).
- esModuleInterop: This enables compatibility with Babel.
- strict: This sets the level of type checking to very high. When this is true, the project is said to be running in strict mode.
- forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: Ensures that the casing of referenced file names is consistent during the type checking process.
- moduleResolution: How module dependencies get resolved, which is node for our project.
- resolveJsonModule: This allows modules to be in .json files which are useful for configuration files.
- noEmit: Whether to suppress TypeScript generating code during the compilation process. This is true in our project because Babel will be generating the JavaScript code.
- jsx: Whether to support JSX in .tsx files.
- include: These are the files and folders for TypeScript to check. In our project, we have specified all the files in the src folder.
